# Digital Garden

My personal corner of the internet. This website serves as a living collection of my work, thoughts, and engineering notes.

## 🧠 What's Here

- **Technical Writing**: Deep dives into production systems, RAG pipelines, and backend architecture.
- **Engineering Notes**: Practical comparisons (e.g., Vector DBs, FastAPI vs Flask) based on real-world experience.
- **Portfolio**: A showcase of my projects and technical journey.
